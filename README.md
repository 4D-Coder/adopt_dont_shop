# adopt_dont_shop

Welcome to Hady and Antonio's Adopt, Don't Shop project! We did this project as part of our computer programming course at Turing School of Software and Design. 

The program is deployed via Heroku at http://gentle-coast-56423.herokuapp.com/ 

The program has been completed through [User Story 14](https://github.com/4D-Coder/adopt_dont_shop/blob/main/doc/user_stories.md) and effectively demonstrates CRUD functionality for both applications and pets.
